# What Energizes Me

> Doing good work

I love writing code but I especially love writing code or documentation that solves or prevents problems. Shipping something that is comprehensively tested & documented gives me confidence I won't have to solve the same problem twice and can move on, saving others from having to do the same thing.

> Ownership and a stake

> Proving others wrong

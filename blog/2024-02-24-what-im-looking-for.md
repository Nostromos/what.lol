## Introduction

After spending 10+ years hiring engineers and the last 2 years learning to code, I'm looking for an opportunity to join an engineering team.

<!-- truncate -->

I started coding with Visual Basic in elementary school, quickly moved on to Flash and Actionscript, and for much of my tech recruiting career, would noodle with Python and JS. When I could build for my org, it was mostly building tools for recruiters with Excel/Google Sheets scripting - think Offer Generators, Offer Comparison tools, Market Analysis sheets, etc.

## Core Principles and Values

My main focus right now is shipping things. I don't care if that's bug fixes, UI tweaks, docs, features, or services. I want a real codebase and a stake in its success. I want to write clean and performant code that solves problems for the business and meets requirements. 

If I had my way, my new workplace would be:
- Collaborative
- Low Overhead
- Innovative
- Growing

I want to learn and see how others do things. Ideally, I don't have to spend most of my time in meetings. When I was in Recruiting, I was lucky to get 1-2 hours a day to put my head down and do deeper work. I want to work with modern technology and ideally the company or product is finding success. 

## Roles I'm Targeting

#### Full Stack

Full stack web might be the sweet spot. I enjoy it and I'm comfortable building almost anything I can think of, at least for my portfolio projects, 

#### Frontend

Frontend greatly interests me and I have (sometimes strong) opinions about UI, UX, and information design. I *enjoy* design but I wouldn't call myself a designer. I've hired and seen what truly great designers can do and I don't think I'm strong in that way. I **am** good at taking designs, having opinions about them, and recreating them in code- pixel-perfect and responsive.

#### Backend

I've got a lot of experience with Typescript and *some* experience with Golang so I think I'd thrive in this space, depending on the role. I'm probably not the guy (right now) to architect a super large scale system, but I might be the guy to build you an API that devs love, or to help improve your CI/CD system, or figure out a faster/cheaper way to deploy and run Some of my most interesting projects were entirely backend focused - building a load balancer, my dinky little compiler, building a log monitoring system, and a kafka clone.

## Skills

I worked at Datadog, Etsy, and Blue Apron. All were growing quickly. I'm comfortable with ambiguity and being mostly autonomous. I'm an excellent cross-functional communicator and consensus-builder, though I know when I can build on my own. I know how to manage a calendar, respond to emails, and stay on top of DMs. I do not post on slack all day.

I'm an excellent learner - fast and smart. I don't just take notes, but also use spaced repetition, active recall, feynman technique, mind-mapping, and others to learn. 

**Languages, Libraries, Frameworks:** Javascript, Typescript, Golang, React, Next, Node, Django, Express, Jest, react-testing-library, Mocha, Storybook, shadcn/ui, Tailwind, HTML/CSS, Zod, MDX, Babel, SQL, clsx, bcrypt, use-debounce, Vitest
**Cloud:** AWS (Lambda, EC2, SSM, SDK, API Gateway, S3, EventBridge, VPC Cloudwatch), DigitalOcean (Droplet VPS), Vercel, Supabase, GCP (Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, BigQuery, GKE, Cloud Run)
**Other:** git/Github, Postgres, SQLite, MongoDB, Prisma, OpenAPI, zsh/Bash, REST API, CI/CD, Web Sockets, VSCode, Docker

## What I Want In My Next Team

I want exposure to a live codebase. I'm sharp, I work hard, I learn quickly. I want to build of course, but I'm just as happy taking tickets and fixing bugs. I have no ego about this. Ideally, I get mentorship and straight feedback from my team but it's a balance. 

## Ideal Work Conditions

### Remote vs On-Site

**In-office** is ideal for me. I much prefer the structure that it provides to my day and I believe in-person collaboration is more effective. Right now, I'm paying for a desk at WeWork to ensure I have a place to go and focus on getting things done.

I'm open to **Flexible** or **Hybrid** situations but I'll try to come in as often as I'm allowed. 

**Remote** is also fine - I do have a desk at a WeWork.

### Benefits

I'm less motivated by benefits beyond health insurance and PTO but would *love* to see 401k match or child care benefits.

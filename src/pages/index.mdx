# Michael Monaghan

Hi, I'm a Software Developer passionate about large-scale systems, beautiful user experiences, and writing clean and efficient code.

Right now, I'm [looking for work](./blog/what-im-looking-for).

I used to work at <EnhancedLogo source={require("@site/static/img/dd_icon_rgb.png").default} imgAlt="Datadog logo" logoText=" Datadog" url="https://datadog.com"/>, <EnhancedLogo source={require("@site/static/img/Color-Etsy-Logo.ico").default} imgAlt="Etsy Logo" logoText="Etsy" url="https://etsy.com" />, <EnhancedLogo source={require("@site/static/img/Blue-Apron-Logo.ico").default} imgAlt="Blue Apron Logo" logoText="Blue Apron" url="https://blueapron.com" />, and <Link to="https://www.interviewjet.com">`InterviewJet`</Link>.

I occasionally write [blog posts](../../blog/) about learning to code and working in tech.

:::info

Most of blog posts from other places aren't live here (yet). Once I've figured out how to syndicate to Medium, I will go live with those.

Outside of programming, I most enjoy spending time with my family & friends, travel, cooking, and diving into new hobbies.

I live in the Red Hook neighborhood of NYC, so if you're around [reach out](./contact/).
